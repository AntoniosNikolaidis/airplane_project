I create an algorithm which create a plane and check if itâ€™s ready to take off. I create 
some employees that everyone has a job to do and when they finish their job the send a 
massage that all is Ok! If all the employees send the message ok then the plane is 
ready to take off . I create classes for every employee and every component of the plane 
and I use inheritance in my classes. At the end I clone an object and I see if objects 
are identical equal or just equal then I use my update function and make some print for 
the length of the string and the middle characters 
For the complication I create a makefile.
So with the command make we can compile it and with ./Air we can run it
