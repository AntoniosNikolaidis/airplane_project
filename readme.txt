I made an algorithm which create a plane and check if itâ€™s ready to take off. I created 
some employees that everyone has a job to do and when they finish their job the send a 
massage that every component is Ok! If all the employees send the message ok then the plane is 
ready to take off . I created classes for every employee and every component of the plane 
and I use inheritance in my classes wherever it is needed. At the end I clone an object and I see if objects 
are identical equal or just equal.Then I am using my update function and completed some prints in order to 
see if the clone object or both objects changed.In addition,i printed the size of the string and the middle characters 
The file compile with the command make and it runs with the command ./Air.
