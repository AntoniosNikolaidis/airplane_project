I made an algorithm which creates an airplane and checks if itâ€™s ready to take off. I created
some employees that have a job to do and when they finish their job they send a
massage that every component is Ok! If all the employees send the message ok then the airplane is
ready to take off. I also created classes for every employee and component of the airplane
and used inheritance in my classes wherever it was needed. In the end, I cloned an object and saw if the objects
were identical equal or just equal.Then I used my updated function and completed some prints in order to
see if the clone object or both objects changed. In addition, I printed the size of the string and the middle
characters. The file compile with the command was made and it run with the command ./Air.
